  "title": "Medpill AI: Medicine Verification Tool",
  "date_range": "2025-06",

  "summary": "Built Medpill AI during Terrahacks to address the global issue of counterfeit medicines. Developed a prototype that verifies medicine authenticity using OCR, embeddings-based similarity search, and scraped reference images.",

  "details": [
    "Implemented OCR-based text extraction from medicine images using an OCR API to support authenticity checks.",
    "Designed a verification pipeline combining web-scraped reference images, embeddings, and similarity search to detect counterfeit medicines.",
    "Collaborated with teammates on ideation, testing, and rapid iteration under strict hackathon time constraints.",
    "Integrated multiple technical components into a functional prototype capable of assisting users in verifying medicine authenticity."
