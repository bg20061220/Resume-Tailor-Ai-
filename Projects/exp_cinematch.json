  "title": "CineMatch: Multi-Model Movie Recommendation System",
  "date_range": "2025-06",

  "summary": "Built CineMatch, a multi-engine movie recommendation system combining content-based filtering, quiz-based preference gathering, and a hybrid model. The app uses TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and user inputs to generate personalized movie suggestions, with dynamic poster fetching via the OMDb API and a Streamlit-based UI.",

  "details": [
    "Implemented TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to build a content-based recommendation engine using movie metadata.",
    "Designed an interactive quiz-based recommender that captures user preferences such as genre, language, and decade.",
    "Developed a hybrid model that merges content similarity with user preferences to improve recommendation accuracy.",
    "Built a fully functional Streamlit application with session state management for smooth multi-step user interactions.",
    "Integrated OMDb API to fetch dynamic movie posters and enhance the user experience."
